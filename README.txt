Hope you enjoy my raindrops game! 
Move your mouse to control the ellipse to catch the raindrops that fall from the top of the display at random. 
The number to your top left is the score and keeps track of how many raindrops you have caught. 
The number to your bottom left is the number of lives you have left and decreases whenever you miss a raindrop. 
The background is a famous scene from the hit TV show "Winnie the Pooh".
I hope you enjoy this blast from your past. 
I know I enjoed creating it!
